# The-Gaming-Room-Design-Document

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game, “Draw It or Lose It that can run on multiple platforms. The game is currently only available on android. The expectation is for the game to allow multiple teams consisting of several people. The game should last four rounds at a minute each. A picture is pulled from a library of images that will “draw” itself at a steady pace while one team guesses until time runs out. If the team is unable to guess each opposing team member gets to guess for 15 seconds.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I was able to clearly identify considerations that need to be made when designing an application. It is important to take the proper time and planning to design the application before beginning to develope it.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Prior planning before developing code creates a road map that takes many aspects into account. This forethought helps to solve problems that may arise, before they do.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would like to continue to develope my unserstanding of memory be able to give more detailed and concise answers when speaking about memory storage.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Meeting the clients needs is best done if you first consider the clients needs. Providing the software that the client is paying for is imperitive to being a successful software engineer. In reading through the needs of The Gaming Room considerations could be made for their design constraints and their need for features such as portability, required storage, and accessibility.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Thinking in terms of what is necessary to meet the needs of the client was very helpful in determining which aspects of the program would be most challengingto implement. It was important to take into consideration their needs for budget, continued support for the application, and the possible need for expansion in the future determined which kind of server to recommend. Additionally, The Gaming Room was looking to expand to more platforms, this made choosing the initial platform and programming language to begin developement with an important choice.

For future projects, I expect that the needs of the client will help to determine which solutions are the best fit for their specific application.
